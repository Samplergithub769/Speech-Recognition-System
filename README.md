# Speech-to-Text with LJSpeech Dataset

Speech recognition is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and computational linguistics that develops methodologies and technologies that enable the recognition and translation of spoken language into text by computers. It is also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition or speech to text (STT).

This project demonstrates a speech-to-text model trained using the LJSpeech dataset. The goal of the project is to convert spoken language into written text using deep learning techniques. The LJSpeech dataset, The dataset contains 13,100 audio files as wav files in the /wavs/ folder. The label (transcript) for each audio file is a string given in the metadata.csv file.The fields are:
- ID: this is the name of the corresponding .wav file
- Transcription: words spoken by the reader (UTF-8)
- Normalized transcription: transcription with numbers, ordinals, and monetary units expanded into full words (UTF-8).
